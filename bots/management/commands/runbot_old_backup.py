RUNBOT_OLD_BACKUP (archived)

This file is an archived copy of an old runbot implementation saved to
archive/restored_files. The active project no longer uses this file because
it contained mixed synchronous/asynchronous code and led to syntax errors
when compiled. It is preserved here for historical reference only.

Do not import or execute this module from the active codebase.
